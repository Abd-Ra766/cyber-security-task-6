## 💡 Tips for Creating Strong Passwords

1. Use at least 12 characters
2. Mix uppercase, lowercase, symbols, and numbers
3. Avoid common words or keyboard patterns
4. Never reuse passwords across different accounts
5. Consider using passphrases like `C0ffee#Is#Life@2025!`

## ⚔️ Common Password Attacks

- **Brute Force**: Attempts all combinations until success
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses common words and patterns
- **Phishing**: Tricks users into revealing passwords

## 🔑 Why Password Length Matters
Longer passwords increase the total number of possible combinations exponentially, making brute-force attacks impractical.

## 🔍 What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?
MFA adds an extra layer of security (like OTPs, fingerprint, or biometrics), even if your password is compromised.

## 📖 What Are Passphrases?
Passphrases are combinations of random words or phrases that are easy to remember but hard to crack. Example: `BlueDuck$Jumps#High!2025`

## 🚫 Common Password Mistakes
- Using `123456`, `password`, or names
- Reusing passwords
- Including personal info
- Writing passwords in unsafe locations

## 🧠 Conclusion
A strong password is your first line of defense against cyber attacks. Testing and improving passwords using online tools helps ensure better account security. Using MFA and a password manager enhances this protection even further.
